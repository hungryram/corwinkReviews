Now that summer is finally out of the way, it is time to play with some fun, new, trendy Fall inspired makeup looks! Whether you're looking to spice up your look for the day or try a spooky season transformation, these makeup trends will have you _Falling_ to try more.

Try a **milk chocolate all brown smokey eye.** Itâ€™s the new classic 2021 trend to try for a daily glam or a perfect night out look. This look is used with deep brown shadows and/or beautiful warm bronzers to soften up the dark tones. All credits for this wonderful look and tutorial go to _@keepin_it_glam__ on TikTok. Check her out!

Feeling Dewy? Try a **glossy brown eye makeup look**. Itâ€™s definitely an eye catcher! Any light or darker nude brown eye shadow will work and to finish, use Fenty Gloss. Itâ€™s as simple as that! This cute makeup look credits goes to _@makeupbymonicaa_ on TikTok.

Another inspiring makeup trend from _@makeupbymonicaa_ on TikTok is the **orange and black reverse cat eye**. Time to bring back the waterline eyeliner because y2k is totally on trend this year! Using only black liner, black eyeshadow, and a warm orange toned eyeshadow, you can create the hottest Fall eye look! Check out Monica and her makeup looks on TikTok.

Maybe spice up your fall look with an **orange & brown toned half cut crease**. This trendy makeup look and tutorial credits go to _@jenna_babess_ from TiKTok. She uses a medium orange, some darker tones, yellow tones, and a blend of brown shadow before starting her half cut crease. She then proceeds to top her cut crease with a light/neutral toned shadow and finishes the look out with some finally glamify-ing touches! Such an amazing look for the Fall and for a fun night out.

There are so many makeup looks to try out this Fall, but these 4 put the spice in pumpkin spice! ðŸŽƒ
